              <p class="role">Piano</p>
              <p>
                Ari Nahum began playing jazz while studying at Colorado College. His musical
                journey from there has been intertwined with medical studies as he explores
                the sounds that capture and encompass the human experience.

              <p class="role">Bass</p>
              <p>
                As a high schooler in Rochester, NY, Jim Pacala began playing gigs by hanging
                out with jazz cat students at the Eastman School of Music. His jazz playing has
                been informed by work in classical, bluegrass, roots, rock, and klezmer, while
                also intertwined, like Ari's, with medical studies.

                Ken Goldman began his percussion studies in Iowa City and later focused on
                classical music at Northwestern University before shifting to drum set. Now
                based in Minneapolis, he performs with local groups and contributes to works
                spanning documentary film, songwriting, and collaborative performance projects.
